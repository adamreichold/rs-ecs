A reasonably simple entity component system (ECS) developed for use in the simulation models of [project group EcoEpi](https://ecoepi.eu/) at the [Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research](https://www.ufz.de/). The design is based on [hecs](https://github.com/Ralith/hecs) but it is _not_ thread-safe and has a significantly reduced API surface.
